# Firecrawl Node SDK

The Firecrawl Node SDK is a library that allows you to easily scrape and crawl websites, and output the data in a format ready for use with language models (LLMs). It provides a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the Firecrawl API.

## Installation

To install the Firecrawl Node SDK, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

## Usage

1. Get an API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)
2. Set the API key as an environment variable named `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` or pass it as a parameter to the `FirecrawlApp` class.

Here's an example of how to use the SDK with error handling:

```js
import FirecrawlApp, { CrawlParams, CrawlStatusResponse } from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

const app = new FirecrawlApp({apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY"});

// Scrape a website
const scrapeResponse = await app.scrapeUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {
  formats: ['markdown', 'html'],
});

if (scrapeResponse) {
  console.log(scrapeResponse)
}

// Crawl a website
const crawlResponse = await app.crawlUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {
  limit: 100,
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: ['markdown', 'html'],
  }
})

console.log(crawlResponse)
```

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL with error handling, use the `scrapeUrl` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

```js
const url = "https://example.com";
const scrapedData = await app.scrapeUrl(url);
```

### Crawling a Website

To crawl a website with error handling, use the `crawlUrl` method. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

```js
const crawlResponse = await app.crawlUrl('https://firecrawl.dev', {
  limit: 100,
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: ['markdown', 'html'],
  }
})
```


### Asynchronous Crawl

To initiate an asynchronous crawl of a website, utilize the AsyncCrawlURL method. This method requires the starting URL and optional parameters as inputs. The params argument enables you to define various settings for the asynchronous crawl, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, permitted domains, and the output format. Upon successful initiation, this method returns an ID, which is essential for subsequently checking the status of the crawl.

```js
const asyncCrawlResult = await app.asyncCrawlUrl('mendable.ai', { excludePaths: ['blog/*'], limit: 5});
```

### Checking Crawl Status

To check the status of a crawl job with error handling, use the `checkCrawlStatus` method. It takes the job ID as a parameter and returns the current status of the crawl job`

```js
const status = await app.checkCrawlStatus(id);
```

### Extracting structured data from a URL

With LLM extraction, you can easily extract structured data from any URL. We support zod schema to make it easier for you too. Here is how you to use it:

```js
import FirecrawlApp from "@mendable/firecrawl-js";
import { z } from "zod";

const app = new FirecrawlApp({
  apiKey: "fc-YOUR_API_KEY",
});

// Define schema to extract contents into
const schema = z.object({
  top: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        points: z.number(),
        by: z.string(),
        commentsURL: z.string(),
      })
    )
    .length(5)
    .describe("Top 5 stories on Hacker News"),
});

const scrapeResult = await app.scrapeUrl("https://firecrawl.dev", {
  extractorOptions: { extractionSchema: schema },
});

console.log(scrapeResult.data["llm_extraction"]);
```

### Map a Website

Use `map_url` to generate a list of URLs from a website. The `params` argument let you customize the mapping process, including options to exclude subdomains or to utilize the sitemap.

```js
const mapResult = await app.mapUrl('https://example.com') as MapResponse;
console.log(mapResult)
```

### Crawl a website with WebSockets

To crawl a website with WebSockets, use the `crawlUrlAndWatch` method. It takes the starting URL and optional parameters as arguments. The `params` argument allows you to specify additional options for the crawl job, such as the maximum number of pages to crawl, allowed domains, and the output format.

```js
// Crawl a website with WebSockets:
const watch = await app.crawlUrlAndWatch('mendable.ai', { excludePaths: ['blog/*'], limit: 5});

watch.addEventListener("document", doc => {
 console.log("DOC", doc.detail);
});

watch.addEventListener("error", err => {
 console.error("ERR", err.detail.error);
});

watch.addEventListener("done", state => {
 console.log("DONE", state.detail.status);
});
```

## Error Handling

The SDK handles errors returned by the Firecrawl API and raises appropriate exceptions. If an error occurs during a request, an exception will be raised with a descriptive error message. The examples above demonstrate how to handle these errors using `try/catch` blocks.
